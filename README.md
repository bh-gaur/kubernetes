# kubernetes
Kubernetes (often abbreviated as K8s) is an open-source container orchestration platform designed to automate the deployment, scaling, and management of containerized applications. It was originally developed by Google and is now maintained by the Cloud Native Computing Foundation (CNCF).

Key Concepts of Kubernetes:
Containers:
Containers (e.g., Docker) allow applications and their dependencies to be packaged together and run consistently across different environments. Kubernetes manages these containers and helps in scaling, networking, and orchestrating them in production.
Cluster:
A Kubernetes cluster is a set of nodes (virtual or physical machines) that run containerized applications. It consists of a master node (responsible for managing the cluster) and one or more worker nodes (which run the application containers).
Nodes:
Master Node: Controls the Kubernetes cluster, managing tasks such as scheduling, scaling, and maintaining the cluster state.
Worker Node: Executes the applications in the containers (via Kubernetes components like kubelet and kube-proxy).
Pods:
The smallest and simplest unit in Kubernetes. A Pod can contain one or more containers. All containers in a Pod share the same network, IP address, and storage, making them work closely together.
Deployment:
A Deployment is a higher-level concept that manages the Pods' lifecycle. It handles creating, updating, and scaling Pods to ensure the application is always available and running as expected.
Services:
A Service in Kubernetes provides a stable endpoint (like an IP address or DNS name) to access a set of Pods. Services ensure that traffic is routed correctly to the appropriate Pods, even as they scale or get replaced.
Namespace:
Namespaces are used to divide resources into multiple virtual clusters within the same physical cluster, allowing for easier management and isolation of different environments (like development, staging, and production).
ReplicaSet:
Ensures that a specified number of replicas (copies) of a Pod are running at any given time, automatically creating or deleting Pods as needed to maintain the desired state.
StatefulSet:
Manages the deployment and scaling of stateful applications (applications that require stable, persistent storage, like databases) in Kubernetes.
Ingress:
An Ingress is an API object that manages external HTTP and HTTPS access to services in a cluster, typically via load balancing, URL routing, and SSL termination.
ConfigMap and Secrets:
ConfigMap is used for storing non-sensitive configuration data that can be shared among Pods.
Secrets store sensitive information like passwords, tokens, or API keys, and are handled securely by Kubernetes.
Volumes:
Kubernetes provides various types of Volumes to persist data. Volumes allow containers to store data that survives pod restarts
